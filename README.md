Project Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on user reviews of a mobile application. The goal is to classify the reviews into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The analysis is conducted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, to understand the general sentiment of users towards the app.

Data Overview

The dataset consists of two main columns:
* reviews: The text reviews provided by users.
* score: A numerical rating (score) given by the user, reflecting their satisfaction with the app.
This dataset can be used to train sentiment analysis models, providing valuable insights into user opinions.

Objectives
* Preprocess reviews using text cleaning techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
* Convert text into numerical representations using TF-IDF.
* Train and evaluate classification models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
* Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new user reviews.

Tools and Technologies
* Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and handling the dataset.
* NLTK and spaCy: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.
* Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and model evaluation.
* TF-IDF: A text vectorization technique used to convert text data into numerical format.
  
Conclusion

This project successfully implements a sentiment analysis model that can classify mobile app reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories. The use of NLP techniques and machine learning models helps in understanding user feedback and can be used to improve app features based on user sentiment.
